					<h1>Trevor addressed different topics including: Racism, love, pain, discrimination.</h1>
					<h2><u>LOVE</u></h2>
</head>

			<body>
				<p>Lets first address love.This is having an affection towards someone or something. It can be
   				pure, painful, sweet, and dreadful.For instance pure , Trevor had never had a love affair with any girl, except when it was valentine’s day and she had to find a valentine who was called Maylene which was not her choice but by considering people’s view.</p>

 				<p>Love can be sweet like in Trevor’s point of view he thought he has lost it all but she later came to meet Lerato. The girl was so beautiful which made Trevor”s uncle to accept to give him the BMW. Trevor had never felt so good like that before. Trevor says that when the girl kissed him on the car, it made him forget everything even about Lerato refusing to dance with him.</p>

				<p>Love can also be painful. Trevor undergone so much in the matters of heart. For instance he was broken during the valentines day.He met the second girl who later travelled abroad without him being able to confess his feelings to her.Lerato refused to dance with him after his struggles to make her appreciate him.He  had applied chemical on his head which burnt him, her mother provoked him by  saying his son had been turned to a girl. It does not feel good.So love can make you undergo different feelings.</p>

					<h2><u>RACISM</u></h2>
				<p>This is discrimination based on your race or colour. During the apartheid time in South Africa, there was racial discrimination since there was churches for the white, mixed and blacks.The white churches were fancier compared to those of blacks.Trevor says that the white churches had jumbotron for those who did not know the song.It was Christian karaoke, basically which was so different in blacks and mixed churches.Trevor says they were so boring and took so long.</p>
				<p>Racism also come out when Trevor says that if you are native American and you pray to the wolves you are a savage.If you are a African and you pray to your ancestors, you are primitive.But when whites pray to a guy who turns water to wine that is common sence.Racism comes in because some silly things which are done by whites are considered intilligent but Africans are seen as primitives.</p>
				<p>When trevor and her mother were standing outside Rosebank Union waiting for a bus for a long time they decided to hitchhike and a certain taxi offered them a ride but they were pulled out by a Zulu driver claiming he was stealing their customers so they boarded the bus.The driver was so angry saying Xhosa women had bad manners.How could she be carried by a whites car?Saying that whores sleep with white men. So racism presents itself since the driver was associating whites with whores which particularly not all  white men are that way.</p>

				<h2><u>DO YOU TAKE RESPONSIBILITIES?</u></h2>
				<p>Trevor had people around him.As mentioned there is a time Trevor shitted on a paper and placed it on a dustbin which he never mentioned about.He made her mother to gather people around so that they can pray since they believed so much on witchcraft.Trevor felt so bad since he had to pray about something which he knew so well.
				Another occasion is when they went to steal from a nearby mall and when his friend was caught he denied everything.</p>

				<h2><u>PASSION</u></h2>
				<p>Trevor had passion in animals.Her mother brought home two beautiful cats.Black cats.Beautiful creatures.In their village anyone who had black cats is like saying I am a witch but since they had moved to the neighbourhood they thought it would be okay.One day they came home and found that the cats had been gutted and skinned and bleeding and their heads had been chopped off.Trevor was not so much attached to them since they had not stayed for long.After the cats were killed they bought dogs: Panther and Fufi.Panther was smart but fufi was so damn.Years later fufi died.The dog was deaf they had no idea.Trevor loved fufi even if it was damn.Beautiful but damn.</p>

					<h1><u>ISOLATION</u></h1>
				<p>Trevor being his father Robert was a swiss/German and her mother Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah was a black gives a vivid description of the title "BORN IN CRIME".It was a crime for a black woman to be in love with a white man and also the vice versa.So Trevor was not associated with her mother since he was a white and her mother was a black.In a point when Trevor went to shop her mother had to deny him and say was not her child since he did not want land into trouble. Trevor was not even whipped by her grandmother. She said she did not know how to whip kids.Trevor was never allowed to move out and play with other children because when a white child would be seen in blacks area he could be taken away.
				When Trevor wanted to go for a walk they had to look for a white woman who could claim that Trevor was her child.He never had enough time to be with her mother.He also never had time to be with his father.He knew nothing about his father.</p>
